	abstract = {The Fermi-Hubbard model is a key concept in condensed matter physics and provides crucial insights into electronic and magnetic properties of materials. Yet, the intricate nature of Fermi systems poses a barrier to answer important questions concerning d-wave superconductivity and quantum magnetism. Recently, it has become possible to experimentally realize the Fermi-Hubbard model using a fermionic quantum gas loaded into an optical lattice. In this atomic approach to the Fermi-Hubbard model the Hamiltonian is a direct result of the optical lattice potential created by interfering laser fields and short-ranged ultracold collisions. It provides a route to simulate the physics of the Hamiltonian and to address open questions and novel challenges of the underlying many-body system. This review gives an overview of the current efforts in understanding and realizing experiments with fermionic atoms in optical lattices and discusses key experiments in the metallic, band-insulating, superfluid and Mott-insulating regimes.},

	abstract = {The spin-½ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a square lattice is used to describe the dynamics of the spin degrees of freedom of undoped copper oxides. Even though the model lacks an exact solution, a solid, accurate, and rather conventional picture emerges from a number of techniques—analytical (spin-wave theory, Schwinger boson mean-field theory, renormalization-group calculations), semianalytical (variational theory, series expansions), and numerical (quantum Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization, etc.). At zero temperature, the effect of the zero-point fluctuations is not strong enough to destroy the antiferromagnetic long-range order, despite the fact that we are dealing with a low-spin low-dimensional system. The corrections to the spin-wave theory, which treats perturbatively the effect of such fluctuations around the classical Néel ground state, appear to be small. At any nonzero temperature the order disappears and the correlation length at low temperature T(kBTJ≪1, where J is the antiferromagnetic coupling) follows the singular form ξ(T)=Cexp(αJkBT). In the long-wavelength limit and at low T, the model has the same behavior as the quantum nonlinear σ model in two spatial dimensions and one Euclidean time dimension, which we also study with available analytical and Monte Carlo techniques. The quasiparticles of the theory are bosons; at low T and for wavelengths shorter than the correlation length they are welldefined spin-wave excitations. The spectrum of such excitations and the temperature-dependent correlation length have been determined by neutron and Raman scattering experiments done on La2CuO4. The good agreement of the experimental data with the predictions of this theory suggests that the magnetic state of the undoped materials is the conventional ordered state. We discuss, within a simple mean-field theory, the effect of weak three-dimensional antiferromagnetic coupling and the role of an antisymmetric term, introduced to explain a hidden ferromagnetic behavior of the uniform susceptibility. We find that understanding the copper-oxide antiferromagnetic insulator is only the first essential step towards the development of a theory of the superconductor created upon doping such materials.},

For example, doping an antiferromagnet is expected to give rise to pseudogap states and high-temperature superconductors1. Quantum simulation2,3,4,5,6,7,8 using ultracold fermions in optical lattices could help to answer open questions about the doped Hubbard Hamiltonian9,10,11,12,13,14, and has recently been advanced by quantum gas microscopy15,16,17,18,19,20. Here we report the realization of an antiferromagnet in a repulsively interacting Fermi gas on a two-dimensional square lattice of about 80 sites at a temperature of 0.25 times the tunnelling energy. The antiferromagnetic long-range order manifests through the divergence of the correlation length, which reaches the size of the system, the development of a peak in the spin structure factor and a staggered magnetization that is close to the ground-state value. We hole-dope the system away from half-filling, towards a regime in which complex many-body states are expected, and find that strong magnetic correlations persist at the antiferromagnetic ordering vector up to dopings of about 15 per cent. In this regime, numerical simulations are challenging21 and so experiments provide a valuable benchmark. Our results demonstrate that microscopy of cold atoms in optical lattices can help us to understand the low-temperature Fermi–Hubbard model.},

N, the electron plus nucleus number, is taken to be less than or equal to the number of lattice sites. We prove the following: (i) For all dimensions, d, the ground state has long range order; in fact it is a perfect crystal with spacing √2 times the lattice spacing. A gap in the ground state energy always exists at the half-filled band point (N = number of lattice sites). (ii) For small, positive temperature, T, the ordering persists when d ⩾ 2.

	abstract = {Electron tunneling across the surface potential barrier has been applied for many years to probe surface atomic and electronic structure. This had led, for example, to the development of the field emission microscope, and more recently, of electron tunneling spectroscopy of insulating barriers in MIM structures. Some four years ago, Binning, Rohrer and coworkers developed the first vacuum tunneling microscope with atomic resolution. In this device, electrons tunnel across a vacuum gap between a sample surface and a scanning tip. Since then, a growing number of research groups have constructed such devices. The STM has provided detailed insight into the atomic structure of surfaces. The feasibility of scanning tunnel spectroscopy (STS) has been demonstrated, though fewer results have been reported. However, before the full potential of the twin techniques of STM and STS can be realized, two problems have to be resolved: (1) A more quantitative, but tractable theory, has to be developed to permit an unambiguous interpretation of the data. (2) A more reliable procedure for the preparation of the tip has to be developed to assure the quantitative reproducibility of the data. A critical review of tunneling theory and the transfer Hamiltonian formalism is presented. Inelastic and elastic resonant tunneling are discussed. The construction and operation of the STM are briefly described. The transfer Hamiltonian theory of the device is reviewed. The concept of surface corrugation is also discussed. Recent results by Kuk on the dependence of the observed corrugation amplitude on the atomic structure of the scanning tip are analyzed. Lastly, image potential states and their significance in the STS study of the electronic structure of the surface barrier are considered.},

	abstract = {We investigate optically detected magnetic resonance signals from an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. The signals are measured for different light powers and microwave powers, and the contrast and linewidth of the magnetic-resonance signals are extracted. For a wide range of experimental settings of the microwave and light powers, the linewidth decreases with increasing light power, and more than a factor of 2 “light narrowing” is observed. Furthermore, we identify that spin-spin interaction between nitrogen-vacancy centers and substitutional nitrogen atoms in the diamond leads to changes in the line shape and the linewidth of the optically detected magnetic resonance signals. Finally, the importance of the light-narrowing effect for optimizing the sensitivity of magnetic-field measurements is discussed.},

	abstract = {Magnetometry and magnetic imaging with nitrogen–vacancy (NV) defects in diamond rely on the optical detection of electron spin resonance (ESR). However, this technique is inherently limited to magnetic fields that are weak enough to avoid electron spin mixing. Here, we focus on the high off-axis magnetic field regime where spin mixing alters the NV defect spin dynamics. We first study, in a quantitative manner, the dependence of the NV defect optical properties on the magnetic field vector B . Magnetic-field-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements are compared to a seven-level model of the NV defect that accounts for field-induced spin mixing. The model reproduces decreases in (i) ESR contrast, (ii) PL intensity and (iii) excited level lifetime with an increasing off-axis magnetic field. We next demonstrate that these effects can be used to perform all-optical imaging of the magnetic field component {\textbar} B ⊥ {\textbar} orthogonal on the NV defect axis. Using a scanning NV defect microscope, we map the stray field of a magnetic hard disc through both PL and fluorescence lifetime imaging. This all-optical method for high magnetic field imaging at the nanoscale might be of interest in the field of nanomagnetism, where samples producing fields in excess of several tens of milliteslas are typically found.},

	abstract = {The atomic force microscope (AFM) system has evolved into a useful tool for direct measurements of micro-structural parameters and unraveling the intermolecular forces at nanoscale level with atomic-resolution characterization. Typically, these micro-cantilever systems are operated in three open-loop modes; non-contact mode, contact mode, and tapping mode. In order to probe electric, magnetic, and/or atomic forces of a selected sample, the non-contact mode is utilized by moving the cantilever slightly away from the sample surface and oscillating the cantilever at or near its natural resonance frequency. Alternatively, the contact mode acquires sample attributes by monitoring interaction forces while the cantilever tip remains in contact with the target sample. The tapping mode of operation combines qualities of both the contact and non-contact modes by gleaning sample data and oscillating the cantilever tip at or near its natural resonance frequency while allowing the cantilever tip to impact the target sample for a minimal amount of time. Recent research on AFM systems has focused on many manufacturing and metrology processes at molecular levels due to its tremendous surface microscopic capabilities. This paper provides a review of such recent developments in AFM imaging system with emphasis on operational modes, micro-cantilever dynamic modeling and control. Due to the important contributions of AFM systems to metrology and biological sciences, this study also provides a comprehensive review of recent applications of different AFM systems in these two important areas.},

Given this array of existing and potential applications and the almost 50 years of NV research, one would expect that the physics of the centre is well understood, however, the study of the NV centre has proved challenging, with many early assertions now believed false and many remaining issues yet to be resolved. This review represents the first time that the key empirical and ab initio results have been extracted from the extensive NV literature and assembled into one consistent picture of the current understanding of the centre. As a result, the key unresolved issues concerning the NV centre are identified and the possible avenues for their resolution are examined.},

However, the effectiveness of the technique when applied to magnetic nanostructures remains to be demonstrated. Here we use a scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometer to image a magnetic vortex, which is one of the most iconic objects of nanomagnetism, owing to the small size ({\textasciitilde}10 nm) of the vortex core. We report three-dimensional, vectorial and quantitative measurements of the stray magnetic field emitted by a vortex in a ferromagnetic square dot, including the detection of the vortex core. We find excellent agreement with micromagnetic simulations, both for regular vortex structures and for higher-order magnetization states.

Given these explanations, a general solution is obtained for the spin in any given electric-magnetic-strain field configuration, and the effects of the fields on the spin's coherent evolution, relaxation, and inhomogeneous dephasing are examined.

For such materials, quantum effects define their physical behaviour and open completely new (quantum) perspectives for applications. Carbon-based materials are particularly good examples, highlighted by the fascinating quantum properties of, for example, nanotubes1 or graphene2. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis and application of ultrapure isotopically controlled single-crystal chemical vapour deposition (CVD) diamond with a remarkably low concentration of paramagnetic impurities. The content of nuclear spins associated with the 13C isotope was depleted to 0.3\% and the concentration of other paramagnetic defects was measured to be {\textless}1013 cm−3. Being placed in such a spin-free lattice, single electron spins show the longest room-temperature spin dephasing times ever observed in solid-state systems (T2=1.8 ms). This benchmark will potentially allow observation of coherent coupling between spins separated by a few tens of nanometres, making it a versatile material for room-temperature quantum information processing devices. We also show that single electron spins in the same isotopically engineered CVD diamond can be used to detect external magnetic fields with a sensitivity reaching 4 nT Hz−1/2 and subnanometre spatial resolution.},

More recently, quantum sensing has become a distinct and rapidly growing branch of research within the area of quantum science and technology, with the most common platforms being spin qubits, trapped ions, and flux qubits. The field is expected to provide new opportunities—especially with regard to high sensitivity and precision—in applied physics and other areas of science. This review provides an introduction to the basic principles, methods, and concepts of quantum sensing from the viewpoint of the interested experimentalist.},

	abstract = {High-spatial-resolution magnetic imaging has driven important developments in fields ranging from materials science to biology. However, to uncover finer details approaching the nanoscale with greater sensitivity requires the development of a radically new sensor technology. The nitrogen–vacancy (NV) defect in diamond has emerged as a promising candidate for such a sensor on the basis of its atomic size and quantum-limited sensing capabilities. It has remained an outstanding challenge to implement the NV centre as a nanoscale scanning magnetic probe at cryogenic temperatures, however, where many solid-state systems exhibit non-trivial magnetic order. Here, we present NV magnetic imaging down to 6 K with 3 μT Hz–1/2 field sensitivity, and use the technique to image vortices in the iron pnictide superconductor BaFe2(As0.7P0.3)2 with critical temperature Tc = 30 K. The expansion of NV-based magnetic imaging to cryogenic temperatures will enable future studies of previously inaccessible nanoscale magnetism in condensed-matter systems.},

We first investigate the behavior of the ESR contrast and linewidth as a function of the microwave and optical pumping power. The experimental results are in good agreement with a simplified model of the NV defect spin dynamics, leading to an optimized sensitivity around 2μT/√Hz for a single NV defect in a high-purity diamond crystal grown by chemical vapor deposition. We then demonstrate an enhancement of the magnetic sensitivity by one order of magnitude by using a simple pulsed-ESR scheme. This technique is based on repetitive excitation of the NV defect with a resonant microwave π pulse followed by an optimized readout laser pulse, allowing to fully eliminate power broadening of the ESR linewidth. The achieved sensitivity is similar to that obtained by using Ramsey-type sequences, which is the optimal magnetic field sensitivity for the detection of a dc magnetic field.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is well known as a powerful technique for visualizing subsurface structures with three-dimensional spatial resolution. Pushing the resolution below 1 µm remains a major challenge, however, owing to the sensitivity limitations of conventional inductive detection techniques. Currently, the smallest volume elements in an image must contain at least 1012 nuclear spins for MRI-based microscopy1, or 107 electron spins for electron spin resonance microscopy2. Magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) was proposed as a means to improve detection sensitivity to the single-spin level, and thus enable three-dimensional imaging of macromolecules (for example, proteins) with atomic resolution3,4. MRFM has also been proposed as a qubit readout device for spin-based quantum computers5,6. Here we report the detection of an individual electron spin by MRFM. A spatial resolution of 25 nm in one dimension was obtained for an unpaired spin in silicon dioxide. The measured signal is consistent with a model in which the spin is aligned parallel or anti-parallel to the effective field, with a rotating-frame relaxation time of 760 ms. The long relaxation time suggests that the state of an individual spin can be monitored for extended periods of time, even while subjected to a complex set of manipulations that are part of the MRFM measurement protocol.},

By measuring the stray field emanating from domain walls in micron-long wires of such materials, we observe deviations from the Bloch profile for TaN and W underlayers that are consistent with a positive DMI value favoring right-handed chiral spin structures. Moreover, our measurements suggest that the DMI constant might vary locally within a single sample, illustrating the importance of local probes for the study of magnetic order at the nanoscale.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging and optical microscopy are key technologies in the life sciences. For microbiological studies, especially of the inner workings of single cells, optical microscopy is normally used because it easily achieves resolution close to the optical wavelength. But in conventional microscopy, diffraction limits the resolution to about half the wavelength. Recently, it was shown that this limit can be partly overcome by nonlinear imaging techniques1,2, but there is still a barrier to reaching the molecular scale. In contrast, in magnetic resonance imaging the spatial resolution is not determined by diffraction; rather, it is limited by magnetic field sensitivity, and so can in principle go well below the optical wavelength. The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging has recently been improved enough to image single cells3,4, and magnetic resonance force microscopy5 has succeeded in detecting single electrons6 and small nuclear spin ensembles7. However, this technique currently requires cryogenic temperatures, which limit most potential biological applications8. Alternatively, single-electron spin states can be detected optically9,10, even at room temperature in some systems11,12,13,14. Here we show how magneto-optical spin detection can be used to determine the location of a spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond with nanometre resolution under ambient conditions. By placing these nitrogen-vacancy spins in functionalized diamond nanocrystals, biologically specific magnetofluorescent spin markers can be produced. Significantly, we show that this nanometre-scale resolution can be achieved without any probes located closer than typical cell dimensions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a single diamond spin as a scanning probe magnetometer to map nanoscale magnetic field variations. The potential impact of single-spin imaging at room temperature is far-reaching. It could lead to the capability to probe biologically relevant spins in living cells.},

	abstract = {Investigations of the magnetic properties of high temperature superconductors (HTSs) have revealed the existence of striking new vortex phenomena due, in part, to their strong crystalline anisotropy, very short coherence lengths and the much larger thermal energies available at high temperatures. Some of these phenomena, for example vortex lattice 'melting', pose serious problems for technological applications of the most anisotropic HTS materials and a fuller understanding of them is of considerable importance. The most direct information regarding vortex structures and dynamics is obtained through local measurement of the magnetic field within or at the surface of a superconducting sample. A detailed review of such local magnetic probes is presented here including Lorentz microscopy, magnetic force microscopy, Bitter decoration, scanning Hall probe microscopy, magneto-optical imaging, and scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy. In each case the principles underpinning the technique are described together with the factors that limit the magnetic field and the spatial and temporal resolution. A range of examples will be given, emphasizing applications in the area of HTSs. In addition the ways in which the existing techniques can be expected to develop over the next few years will be discussed and new approaches that seem likely to be successful described.},
